# AdventOfCode2022

For this year's Advent of Code, I decided to use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to see how well it would write code. 

I followed 2 rules:
- I waited so that I would in no way impact the leaderboard.
- I did not paste in the problems directly from AoC. Instead, I described to ChatGPT what functionality the code needed to perform/wrote pseudocode. Sometimes I would ask it to refactor or use a different data structure to improve performance.

Interesting observations so far:
- ChatGPT will code things differently if you submit the same prompt more than once (in different chat threads). 
- It does a good job of explaining error messages - which would then help me to modify the prompt in some way (usually I hadn't explained what I wanted correctly, or I hadn't given it enough guidance).
- It doesn't check for error conditions unless specifically asked to.
